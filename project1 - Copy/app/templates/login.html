<h1>Analysis of Petroleum Losses</h1>
    <p>The transportation and marketing of petroleum liquids involve many distinct operations, each of
which represents a potential source of evaporation loss. Crude oil is transported from production operations
to a refinery by tankers, barges, rail tank cars, tank trucks, and pipelines. Refined petroleum products are
conveyed to fuel marketing terminals and petrochemical industries by these same modes. From the fuel
marketing terminals, the fuels are delivered by tank trucks to service stations, commercial accounts, and local
bulk storage plants. The final destination for gasoline is usually a motor vehicle gasoline tank. Similar
distribution paths exist for fuel oils and other petroleum products
.</p> 
    <p> Evaporative emissions from the transportation and marketing of petroleum liquids may be
considered, by storage equipment and mode of transportation used, in four categories:
1. Rail tank cars, tank trucks, and marine vessels: loading, transit, and ballasting losses.
2. Service stations: bulk fuel drop losses and underground tank breathing losses.
3. Motor vehicle tanks: refueling losses.
4. Large storage tanks: breathing, working, and standing storage losses</p>
